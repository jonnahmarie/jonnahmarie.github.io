# Responsive Portfolio Project

This project aimed to create a mobile responsive designed portfolio using Bootstrap CSS Framework, in addition to using Bootstrap's grid systems. The portfolio I created consisted of 3 pages: an about me/home page, a portfolio page, and a contact page. All 3 page files have a consistent nav bar and a responsive layout that adjusts to screen size. The portfolio page has responsive images adjusts to the screen size as well. The portfolio also made use of Bootstrap's grid system and used sub-rows and sub-columns.

There are no media queries used in my customized stylesheet.
